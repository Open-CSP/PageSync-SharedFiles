# PageSync Shared Files


This information comes from this page : https://www.open-csp.org/DevOps:Doc/PageSync/2.1/submit_a_share_file


_If you think you have an PageSync ShareFile that is interesting for others and you would like to have it show up in the list on the PageSync Special page, then **read on**._


## How to add to the PageSync Sharefile repo
More on creating a Shared file can be found here : https://www.open-csp.org/DevOps:Doc/PageSync/2.1/share_pages

When creating the share file, all necessary form fields must have been filled using the English language.

### Forking
You can fork https://github.com/Open-CSP/PageSync-SharedFiles.

Add your own PageSync Share File in the correct category. Currently we have "General", "Extensions", 'Company", "Open-CSP".

Inside the category you create a folder with a valid and logical name. See this as the subcategory.

* Tip: Good change there's already a subcategory for e.g. a popular extension, then you can copy that and change the necessary information.
Good Example is "Extensions/FlexForm".

In this folder you can upload your PageSyncShare File. Use the original Filename that PageSync produced!

Then add your information to the index.json in the root of the Repository. This information is displayed on the PageSync Shared Files list.

That's it.
